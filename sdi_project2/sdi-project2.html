<p>
	This "story" is part 2 of project 1. In this part we find out who has tickets and if they
	have them all the way to the final destination. So even though our final, final destination
	is Indiana, the last Airport we go to is in Chicago because that's where the cheapest airfair
	is to. That's why the last half of the app tests to see who has a reserved seat to Chicago.
